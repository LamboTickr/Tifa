<h2> Tifa, the best character</h2>	
	<p>I like Tifa Lockhart. She is a cool character from an even cooler game. She looks like this:</p>

<p> Tifa also has a really cool theme song that helps me to relax after a stressful day. You can listen here: <p/>

<P> When the war of the beasts brings about the world's end,<br>
The goddess descends from the sky,<br>
Wings of light and dark spread afar,<br>
She guides us to bliss, her gift everlasting.<br> </p>
